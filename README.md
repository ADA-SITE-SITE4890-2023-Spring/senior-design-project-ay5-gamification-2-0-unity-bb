    <h1>Unity-Blackboard Integration</h1>
    <p>This project provides a way to integrate Unity game engine with Blackboard LMS, allowing game developers to create games that can be imported into Blackboard and used as educational tools for students. With this integration, students can play games directly from Blackboard and their progress can be tracked and monitored by teachers.</p>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To get started with this project, you will need to have Unity installed on your computer. You can download Unity from the official website <a href="https://unity.com/">here</a>.</p>
    <p>You will also need to have access to Blackboard LMS. You can learn more about Blackboard and how to get started with it on their website <a href="https://www.blackboard.com/">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Once you have Unity and Blackboard set up, you can download the Unity package from the releases section of this repository. The package contains all the necessary scripts and assets to get started with integrating Unity and Blackboard.</p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>To use the Unity-Blackboard integration package, simply import it into your Unity project. You can then create your own games or modify the included example game to suit your needs.</p>
    <p>Once your game is complete, you can export it as a Blackboard package and import it into your Blackboard course. Students can then play the game directly from Blackboard and their progress will be tracked and monitored by teachers.</p>
